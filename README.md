# Barrier Synchronization Primitive

- An implementation of a barrier synchronization primitive that allows N threads, where N is a fixed number, to wait until all of them have reached a certain point. Once all threads have reached this certain point (the barrier), they may all continue.
- For further details please take a look at the Description.pdf file.
- This program was written in c++ language as part of a homework exercise in the course "Operating Systems" of the Technion.
